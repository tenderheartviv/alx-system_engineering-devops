Debugging involves identifying and resolving software errors that hinder its proper execution. As you progress in your programming expertise and professional engineering career, you'll acquire skills in utilizing debugging tools like gdb or integrated tools within IDEs. Nevertheless, grasping the fundamental concepts and manual debugging processes is crucial. In this project, we delve into the second phase of creating an optimal framework and blueprint for debugging web stack issues, particularly in the context of remote containers.
